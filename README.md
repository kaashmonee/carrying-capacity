# Carrying Capacity Simulation

## Sypnosis

In ecology, due to limited resources like food, water, habitat, etc, a particular environment can only sustain a finite nubmer of individuals. This number is denoted "k," the carrying capacity. The number of organisms in an environment can be modeled with a differential equation and the population experiences exponential growth or decline, depending on whether or not the initial population is greater than or less than the carrying capacity. This is a simulation that shows visually how a population will evolve over time. Please enjoy.
